# Apple Homepage Clone

## About

This is the clone of the first three sections of the Apple's website home page based on the following figma [Figma Community by David Somper](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1175869172569168844).

I made this project with the specific goal to learn how to deploy a static website hosting on AWS using Amazon S3 service.

## Stack
